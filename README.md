NumPy Material to Learn and Practise

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

    1.a powerful N-dimensional array object
    2.sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    3.tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
    4.useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
